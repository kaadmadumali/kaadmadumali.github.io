### RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS

#### Research Publications

- **“Effect of Improving Indoor Air Quality Using Some Selected C3 Plants and CAM Plants”** at 9th International Conference on Sustainable Built Environment, Kandy, Sri Lanka.

This research is based on screening some selected plant species of C3 and CAM plants for  their ability to improve indoor air quality by absorbing elevated CO2 concentrations during day and night times. The selected species showed a considerable interspecific variation in reducing CO2 concentrations during day and night.

- **“Effect of Some Selected Plant Species in Ameliorating Indoor CO2 Concentration”** at 2nd International Research Symposium at Uva Wellassa University, Sri Lanka.

This research is based on identification of appropriate plant species effective in improving indoor air quality by absorbing CO2 during day time and at night. Research was done to address the issue of deteriorating indoor air quality in highly congested, ill-ventilated and ill-lit abodes in urbanized areas.
